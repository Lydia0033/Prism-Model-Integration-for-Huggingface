# Prism-Model-Integration-for-Huggingface
The goal of this project is to integrate Prism, a multilingual trained Machine Translation (MT) model, into the Huggingface ecosystem. While Prism currently exists within Fairseq, we aim to extend its support to Huggingface, enabling easier access and utilization for a broader community of developers and researchers.
